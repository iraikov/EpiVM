{-
   Store a list of rational numbers as a common denominator, then a list
   of numerators, all stored as doubles: this lets us write the values in
   the source as exact rational numbers, yet we can take advantage of not
   having to do too many conversions and also of not having to multiply
   by 0 or 1 in some cases.
